This was a Freelancer project for a Brazilian company where I use JavaScript, HTML and CSS to develop

This website is Frontend only to reduce cloud costs

On AWS, I use a S3 bucket to store the documents, a CloudFront to redirect the website for a https protocol and a Route53 to redirect the users to www.blan.ind.br url
